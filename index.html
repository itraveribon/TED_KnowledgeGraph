<p>The TED talks knowledge graph (items.json) consists of 846 talks and 125 playlists. Playlists are described with a title and the set of included TED talks. Each TED talk is described with the following set of datatype properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>dc:title (Dublin Core vocabulary) or title of the talk.,</li>
<li>dc:creator or speaker,</li>
<li>dc:description or abstract,</li>
<li>ted:relatedTags or set of related keywords.</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from the datatype properties, talks are connected to playlists that include them through the object property ted:playlist. A vol:hasLink (Vocabulary Of Links <a href="http://purl.org/vol/ns/">http://purl.org/vol/ns/</a>) object property connect each pair of talks that are together in at least one playlist.
We crawled the playlists available in the TED website <a href="http://www.ted.com/playlists">http://www.ted.com/playlists</a>. Playlists contain sets of TED talks that usually address similar topics. TED playlists are created and maintained by curators, who decide if a certain video may or may not be included in a certain playlist.</p>

<p>Additionally, we enriched the knowledge graph by adding similarity values between each pair of entities. We computed four similarity measures (TFIDF, ESA} and Doc2Vec) using as input the concatenation of datatype properties title, description and related tags. ESA similarity values were obtained using the public ESA endpoint <a href="http://vmdeb20.deri.ie:8890/esaservice">http://vmdeb20.deri.ie:8890/esaservice</a>, and Doc2Vec (D2V) values were obtained training the gensim implementation~ with the pre-trained Google News dataset <a href="https://goo.gl/flpokK">https://goo.gl/flpokK</a>.</p>

<p>Similarity values are stored in three different matrix where the content of the position [i,j] corresponds to the similarity between talks i and j. i and j corresponds to the i-th and j-th talks described in the items.json file.</p>
